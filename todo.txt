Current task:

Add charset switching for windows
Look into fixing command entry backspace for windows

Implement save and/or verb blocking
    E.g. to prevent saving on the title screen
    and to prevent score checking on title screen

    Make wax create directories as needed

Create game saved check and confirm. Possibly as a decorator

Test on a windows machine i guess

Renderer/sprite animation and cutscene support:
    Renderer functions to trigger non-blocking animations
    in sprites, flag actions with names
    Renderer functions to block until named actions finish

Add sound support

Fix cursor weirdness
--give command line info to renderer so it can reposition cursor?
--python curses threading?
