Current task:
Implementing bldgfx

Move cframe/tick to sprite?
Else make sprites only tick once per cycle when duplicate images

Store sprites in buffer by id

---------------------------------

bldgfx module:

Make Manager class
    Holds dictionary of images and filenames
    Loads images as needed to avoid loading duplicate images 

Make Sprite class
    Holds an image name and position
    Has a layer
    Has tick and draw functions that pass on to image
    Handles fancy stuff like moving images around


Make Renderer class
    Has a dictionary of layers holding lists of sprits
    Has a buffer dictionary
    Has a refresh function that replaces the rendering dict with buffer
    Has a play/paused
    Has a thread that ticks sprites in main dict and draws in order
    Has a function to clear buffer
    Has a window to draw in


---------------------------------

Make starting room image

Add image support to pybld

Fix stand mechanics for stand down, etc
